# Proof of Concept
This is just a PoC to show the usage for Flask + Nginx. The main goal here is to deploy multiple flasks instances by using an nginx server so they can "modify and read" cookies from other apps.

## How to run
First of all you need docker, after you've setup your docker environment simply run `./run_docker.sh res` which means everything you be restarted with brand new images.

## By the way..
This is just a PoC, do what you want with this, there is no license.
